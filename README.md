# Mozilla Design System

A modular design system for Mozilla websites.

## Quick Start

This design system uses [Drizzle](https://github.com/cloudfour/drizzle/), a Node-based toolkit for developing and presenting UI pattern libraries, by [Cloud Four](https://cloudfour.com/).

0. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Run `npm start` in the resulting directory.

This will install dependencies, build the site, and start the development server at <http://localhost:3000>.

See the docs for more.
